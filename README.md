# Solutions to differen CodeForces tasks

## Programming Language

To solve the different kind of tasks, `C++` is used.

## Common problems

When writing a solution, it leads to a runtime error, when the `main` function has a `return 1/0` statement. Therefore the basic file should always look like this:

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Insert Code here - without return statement
}
```

The site works like the following:

- **Inputs** are given with the `std::cin` function
- **Outputs** are recieved with the `std::cout` function

Therefore, the console cannot be used to get informations for the user on how to run the programm properly.
